# Spiritual Discernment

Discern whether spiritual experiences, consolations, or inner movements are genuinely from God. Based on Teresa of Ávila's extensive teaching on testing the spirits.

---

## When to Use

- After unusual spiritual experiences
- When inner voices or promptings arise
- When consolations feel overwhelming
- When uncertain about spiritual phenomena

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Is this experience from God?"
- "How do I know if this is real?"
- "I had a vision/feeling/sense—what does it mean?"
- "Something happened in prayer—should I trust it?"

- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Teresa's Criteria for Genuine Experience

| Mark of Authenticity | Mark of Deception |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Leaves lasting peace | Leaves agitation or unease |
| Increases humility | Increases pride or self-importance |
| Produces love for others | Produces isolation or judgment |
| Bears good fruit in action | Leads to neglect of duties |
| Brings clarity about God | Creates confusion |
| Can be submitted to authority | Resists examination |

---

## Key Questions

1. **What fruit does it bear?** Love, joy, peace, patience? Or anxiety, pride, restlessness?

2. **Does it humble you?** True experience of God reveals your smallness. False experience inflates.

3. **Can you let it go?** If you're desperate to hold on, something is wrong.

4. **Does it align with faith and reason?** God does not contradict Scripture or sound teaching.

5. **What do wise others say?** Consult a spiritual director or confessor.

## Three Sources of Spiritual Experience

1. **From God** - Leaves peace, humility, love; bears lasting fruit
2. **From self** - Feels good but produces no change; often tied to emotional needs
3. **From the enemy** - May seem holy but leads to pride, isolation, or disobedience

## Teresa's Counsel

> "I do not fear Satan half so much as I fear those who fear him."

Don't be paranoid, but don't be naive. Test everything. Trust the fruits.
